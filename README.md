# E-Commerce Recruitment Task

( ! Work in Progress ! )

This repository contains a simple e-commerce application built with Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. The application allows users to browse products, add them to a cart, and view the cart contents.

## Requirements

To keep `node` and `pnpm` versions the same on development environments, use [Volta](https://volta.sh/).

Required versions are specified in the `package.json` file under the `volta` field:

```json
  "volta": {
    "node": "22.18.0",
    "pnpm": "10.14.0"
  },
```

## Getting Started

### Development Setup

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start the development server
pnpm dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.
